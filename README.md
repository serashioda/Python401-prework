Python401-prework

This is a repository created for Python401 Codecademy prework. A branch, codecademy, was also created to showcase the code in specific exercises from the Python Track. 

I have made a .py for each of these challenges:
- Unit 3: PygLatin - part 10
- Unit 4: Taking a Vacation - part 7
- Unit 5: A Day at the Supermarket - part 12
- Unit 6: Student Becomes the Teacher - part 9
- Unit 7: Battleship! - part 18
